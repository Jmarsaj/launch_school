Things to consider
1. Notice how the display_results method calls the prompt method. What happens if you 
move the display_results method definition above the prompt method definition? 
Does it still work?
A. Yes it still works since it display_results is invoked after prompt method definition

2. Create another method called test_method at the very top, before the prompt method definition.
Now try invoking the newly created method from just after the prompt method definition. 
Does it work? Now try invoking the method again just before the prompt method definition. 
Does it work? Why is there a different result?
A. Invoking the method after the prompt method definition works
   Invoking the method before the prompt method definition produces an error
